    {
      "title": "Embodied Knowledge is Valid Knowledge",
      "insight": "The kitchen-laboratory's findings are valid because they are reproducible and effective. Modern chemistry explains why they work; the practice already knew that they worked."

      "title": "Reframe 'Survival Food'",

    {
      "title": "Look for the Principle, Not Just the Recipe",
      "insight": "In food history, the silent, repeated steps—the 'why ash?' moments—often hold deeper, more resilient history than the named dishes. They are the archival fingerprints of a working system."
    }
  ],
  
  "conclusion": {
    "statement": "The alkaline principle survived because it is a rigorously effective solution to a recurring material problem. Its movement across oceans and centuries is the migration of a working logic.",
    "final_truth": "What endures is not belief, but calibration. Not story, but a solution that keeps solving. The laboratory was never institutionalized, and therefore it was never decommissioned. Its archive is not on paper, but in the hands that know, the eyes that judge, and the enduring, quiet intelligence of a method that, when asked 'why ash?', has only one true answer: because it works."
